# Dirty Data project
## Introduction
As part of Data Analysis course at CodeClan, I was asked to do at least 2 tasks out of 6 for the dirty data project (task 4 was mandatory). The aim of the project was to practice **data cleaning** skills since it is known that 
> 80% of time in data science and analysis is spent data cleaning.

## Project structure
All the project was made in Rstudio.
Each task was supposed to have 4 different folders:

```
raw_data
data_cleaning_scripts
clean_data
documentation_and_analysis
```
Analysis for each task can be found in **analysis** folder with comments. A cleaning script is in a separate folder as potentially, it can be run on raw data with similar structures and contents.  

##
