# Dirty Data project
## Introduction
As part of Data Analysis course at CodeClan, each of us had to do at least 2 tasks out of 6 for dirty data project. The aim of the project is to practice **data cleaning** skills since it is known that '80% of time in data science and analysis is spent data cleaning'.
